let name = 'Mosh'; // String Literal
let age = 30; // Number Literal
let isApproved = true; // Boolean Literal

let firstName; // if we don't initialize it, by default it's value is undefined
let firstName = undefined; // we could explicitly defined as undefined BUT that's not very common

let selectedColor = null; // is used in situation when we wanna clear the value of variable, e.g. list of colors, if the user has no selection, we set 'null'. in the future if the user selects the color, we reassign this variable to a color like 'red'
